## About Me

I would like to have a job where I can grow as web developer, fulfill myself and put my knowledge into practice. My goal at the moment is to find a job where i can get new useful experience . I'm curious so I always want to know more. Problems and difficult tasks do not scare me. 
Personal skills:  sociable, disciplined, curious.
In my free time I study additional information for professional development on websites habr. Stackoverflow is my faithful assistant in finding solutions.
Medium.com also turned out to be extremely heplful in keeping up with new features, versions and approaches.
In the future I would like to become a skilled web developer. 

The books I have read:
Eloquent Javascript by Marijn Haverbeke
You Don't Know JS  by Kyle Simpson
Javascript: The Definitive Guide by David Flanagan

#Code example: `
exports.min = function min (array) {
	if((!array) || !array.length){
		return 0
	}
  return  Math.min(...array);
}

exports.max = function max (array) {
	if((!array) || !array.length){
		return 0
	}
  return Math.max(...array);
}

exports.avg = function avg (array) {
	if((!array) || !array.length){
		return 0
	}
  return array.reduce((a,b)=> a + b, 0)/array.length;
}
